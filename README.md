##This project is a simple lexical analyzer (also known as a lexer) designed to identify and categorize various components of a source code input file, such as keywords, operators, and identifiers. The lexical analyzer reads the input source code and categorizes each token (word or symbol) into one of these three categories. This is a fundamental component for building a compiler or interpreter for a programming language.
